Netatmo Java API (unofficial)
========

Small adaption of the original [Netatmo Android API][1] that can be used with plain Java (>=v8) instead of Android. Nothing special, but might help you getting started as some parsing and the OAuth2 stuff is already handled (many thanks to those folks at [Apache Oltu][2]!).

Documentation of their API is available at https://dev.netatmo.com/doc/.

Installation
--------
Now available at Maven Central, so just add the dependency to your ```pom.xml```.

    <dependencies>
        [...]
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.losty.netatmo</groupId>
            <artifactId>netatmo-api</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.0</version>
        </dependency>
        [...]
    </dependencies>

Usage
--------

You'll get CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET at https://dev.netatmo.com/dev/createapp.

	NetatmoHttpClient client = new NetatmoHttpClient(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET);
	client.login(E_MAIL, PASSWORD);
	
	List<String> types = Arrays.asList(Params.TYPE_TEMPERATURE, Params.TYPE_PRESSURE, Params.TYPE_HUMIDITY);
	ZonedDateTime dateBegin = ZonedDateTime.parse("2015-09-10T00Z");
	ZonedDateTime dateEnd = ZonedDateTime.parse("2015-09-11T00Z");
	Station station = client.getStationsData().get(0);
	
	List<Measures> measures = client.getMeasures(station, station.getModules().get(0), types, Params.SCALE_MAX, dateBegin, dateEnd, null, null);
	for (Measures measure : measures) {
		new DateTime(measure.getBeginTime()).withZone(DateTimeZone.UTC).toString();
		measure.getTemperature();
		measure.getPressure();
		measure.getHumidity();
		...

What else?
--------

Hmm... That's about it!

Forks, PRs and stuff is always welcome!
